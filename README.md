animated birds shooting from the trees (owls?)
Visual script:

splash screen: Cyberhippie

title: Loads of swirling autumn leaves, small owls from time to time (actually just a single owl or two swooshing underneath the title). Screen moves downwards along the falling leaves and we arrive at the image of a lodge without anyone around. It's covered in leaves, untended, it looks abandoned. The menu appears 'Begin' / 'Options' / 'Turn around' (exit).

after pressing 'Begin' telephone intro (fully voiced) Narrator: 'Welcome, good ol' pal. I've been waiting for your call.' (for years) Narrator: 'I've set up everything, your place of comfort is ready' (the plan is in motion) Narrator: 'Wish you all the best'

road to the lodge

arriving at the lodge (…) Narrator: 'Welcome to the lodge, pal. Make some tea, roll a cigarette and enjoy your stay' and the events can only go in one direction.

Man who died at Lake Retreat remembered as lover of the outdoors

loved the outdoors, hunting and fishing. The 23-year-old Rural Retreat resident died over the weekend while apparently doing one of those things. According to the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Whalen’s body was pulled Sunday from the Old Man's Retreat around 8:56 p.m. by a dive team. The body was transported to Wythe County Community Hospital and then to the medical examiner’s office in Roanoke to determine the cause of death.

Lee Walker, outreach director for the DGIF, said autopsy results usually take more than a week to complete. He reported that Whalen was known to have seizures.

Based on an account from the Whalen family, the following events took place.

William Patrick Whalen, known by everyone as “Will,” had stayed home Saturday with his dad, James, while his mother, brother and other relatives left for a vacation at Long Beach, N.C. He decided to go fishing at the lake between 7:30 and 8 a.m. on Saturday.

When Whalen had not been heard from by 2 p.m., his dad called the beach group and learned they had not been contacted either.

“It really wasn’t that unusual not to hear from him,” the spokesman said. “Will would go out in the woods and places where his cell phone wouldn’t have reception.”

Around 7 p.m., his dad went looking for him. He found his flat-bottomed bass boat near the banks of Rural Retreat Lake and his son’s truck still parked there.

“He called us and I called a police friend of mine,” the spokesman said. “They found the body at 10:30 a.m. Sunday. We came back home.”

According to Walker, the Longshop McCoy River Rescue, the Virginia Tech Dive Team and the Wythe County Dive Team assisted in the search. The DGIF Dive Team also was called but the body was recovered before the team could dive.

Walker reported that there was no alcohol found in the boat. Life jackets, Walker said, were on the boat but were not being worn by the victim.

The family spokesman said Whalen was a 2008 graduate of Rural Retreat High School and was a grounds man for L.E. Myers, working away from home. He loved sports, with the Cleveland Indians and the Philadelphia Eagles being his favorite teams, the spokesman noted.

Whalen, who played high school baseball with the Rural Retreat Indians, enjoyed singing and playing the guitar. He often performed at Mt. Ephraim United Methodist Church, where he attended.

Sgt. David Evans of the Wythe County Sheriff’s Office and chief of the Rural Retreat Volunteer Fire Department has known the Whalen family for years. He said Whalen’s father and brother Cory are members of the fire department.

“I’ve known Will for about 10 years,” Evans said. “He was a good person. He loved the outdoors and hunting and fishing.”

Evans was at the scene when Whalen’s body was recovered.

“All of us were in shock,” he said. “To know someone personally and the family made it worse,”

Whalen’s funeral will be held Thursday, June 20, at 3 p.m. at Mt. Ephraim United Methodist Church. The family will receive friends from 1 to 3 p.m. at the church.

Burial will be in Rosewood Memorial Gardens.

A lake near the Scott and Wise county line was the site of a second weekend death when a 55-year-old man and his horse drowned in Bark Camp Lake.

According to the U.S. Forestry Service, Lindsey Stephen Burke of Nickelsville died around 3 p.m. Saturday.

Investigators said the horse panicked in the water and Burke got caught in the stirrups and was dragged deeper into the lake.

The last Rural Retreat Lake fatality was in 2006, when a 17-year-old Smyth County boy drowned while trying to swim across the water.
